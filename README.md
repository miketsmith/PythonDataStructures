# PythonDataStructures
Assignments :)

Here's a link to a website explaining various data structures.  This is good stuff, they cover most of what a class would cover, and give ideas for assignments. https://medium.freecodecamp.org/10-common-data-structures-explained-with-videos-exercises-aaff6c06fb2b

This is being put together as a place to have your code reviewed.

# A couple of pre-reqs:
1) Install an IDE. I recommend Anaconda/Spyder, but you may want to look around in the future: https://www.anaconda.com/download/  We're going to use Python 3.  There are differences between 2 and 3.

2) Learn the language.  Go through the tutorial material, try some of the examples. https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/.  Use This github (or rather, a fork of this github) to show any code you write.

3) Documentation and Stack Overflow are your friends.  If you don't know quite how to do something, the first place you should turn is Google.  Being a software developer, is at least in part, knowing how to look things up when you don't know them.
